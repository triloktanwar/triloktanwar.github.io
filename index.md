## About the Project
The **AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EQ** repository contains valuable resources for anyone interested in artificial intelligence and the EQ programming language. The datasets included here are designed to help developers and researchers work with AI2001 projects more effectively.

This repository aims to provide:
- High-quality datasets for the EQ language.
- Source code examples that illustrate the use of these datasets.
- Tools and scripts to assist in the development process.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to download the source code and datasets. You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/triloktanwar/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EQ/releases). 

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Git
- Any necessary libraries (as specified in the requirements file)

## Installation
Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/triloktanwar/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EQ.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EQ
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the datasets from the releases section. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/triloktanwar/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-EQ/releases).

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the datasets and source code. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   import eq_language
   ```

2. Load a dataset:
   ```python
   dataset = eq_language.load_dataset('path/to/dataset')
   ```

3. Perform operations on the dataset:
   ```python
   results = eq_language.analyze(dataset)
   ```

Refer to the documentation for more detailed examples and advanced usage.

## Datasets
This repository includes various datasets specifically designed for the EQ programming language. Each dataset comes with its own set of documentation, explaining its structure and how to use it.

### Available Datasets
